 * The Event Request Unit (ERU) architecture includes three subunits: Event Request Select (ERS), Event Trigger Logic (ETL), and Output Gating Unit (OGU).<br>
 * Thus, the ERU personality is represented as the three personalities of the ERU subunits. <br>
 *
 * For more details, refer to:<br>

 * \subsection subsection_personality_ers ERS Personality
 * The ERS personality provides a graphical interface to connect a corresponding ERS input channel to a specific event source, to determine the ERS output
 * signal Combination Logic, and to connect an ERS unit with a corresponding ETL unit.

 * After ERS is set, the next step of the ERU adjustment by the configuration chain is configuration of the \ref subsection_personality_etl "ETL".
 *
 * \subsection subsection_personality_etl ETL Personality
 * The ETL personality provides a graphical interface to determine the conditions of incoming signal processing. If the incoming signal
 * satisfies the conditions defined by the "Edge Detection" parameter, the signal is regarded as a true event.<br>
 * The event generates a trigger, whose distribution path to OGU is also controlled by the parameters of the ETL personality GUI. <br>

 * To continue ERU adjustments, go to the \ref subsection_personality_ogu "OGU" personality configuration by the configuration chain.
 *
 * \subsection subsection_personality_ogu OGU Personality.
 * An OGU unit combines trigger events and status information and gates the Output. The OGU personality provides a graphical interface to determine in which
 * way that will occurs.
 * \note
 * The OGU settings may be set so that an event of one Input will lead to reactions on several Outputs.
 *
 * OGU Outputs may be used as triggers for the other units, for example, to DMA.<br>
 * An OGU reaction may be setting the service request generation. To enable the service request generation, check the "Pattern Detection" parameter. <br>
