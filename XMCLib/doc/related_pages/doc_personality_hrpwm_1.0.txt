 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_csg Comparator &amp; Slope Generation Unit (CSG)
 * The personality provides the following functionalities using the CSG peripheral:
 * -# Inverting the comparator output.
 * -# Blanking the comparator output.
 * -# Clamping the comparator output.
 * -# Slope generation in Decrementing mode.
 * -# Slope generation in Incrementing mode.
 * -# Slope generation in Triangle mode.
 * -# Updating the slope start and stop value.
 *
 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_hrc High Resolution Channel (HRC)
 * The personality provides the following functionalities using the CCU8 and HRC peripherals:
 * -# PWM signal generation on the selected port pins.
 * -# Setting the required frequency of operation and initial duty cycle with the high-resolution positioning.
 * -# Start the PWM unit after initialization or at a later time as required.
 * -# Operate the PWM in Single shot or Continuous mode.
 * -# Start multiple timers in the kernel synchronously.
 * -# Generate PWM in Edge/Center aligned, Symmetric/Asymmetric mode.
 * -# Select the passive state of the output.
 * -# Connect up-to-three external event signals. The following functions can be implemented:
 *    - External Start
 *    - External Stop
 *    - External Count Direction
 *    - External Gating
 *    - External Count
 *    - External Load
 *    - External Modulation
 *    - External Override (Level)
 *    - External Trap
 * -# Enable the period match or compare match events.
 * -# Generate dead time between complementary outputs.
 * -# Generate up-to-two PWMs with CCU8 and HRC slices.
 *
 * The next figure shows the functional overview of the PWM generation. The period match (PM) value is calculated
 * based on the frequency and the compare match (CM) is calculated based on the duty cycle. The PWM state changes at the period and compare matches.

 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_edge_symmetric CCU8 in Edge Aligned Symmetric Mode of Operation
 * In this mode, we can use the 2 compare registers to generate 2 pairs of complementary outputs, which means a total of 4 outputs.
 * The minimum duty that can be generated is 0% and the maximum is 100%. Here, the output is initially LOW until a compare match occurs.
 * The output remains HIGH until a next match occurs.

 * <b>Example with XMC4400:</b>
 *
 * \f$ Clock = 120MHz. \f$
 *
 * \f$ Prescaler = 0. \f$

 * \f$ Required\:frequency\:of\:operation\:(F) = 100KHz. \f$

 *
 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_center_symmetric CCU8 in Center Aligned Symmetric Mode of Operation
 * In this mode, we can use the 2 compare registers to generate 2 pairs of complementary outputs, which means a total of 4 outputs.
 * The minimum duty that can be generated is 0% and the maximum is 100%. Here, the output is initially LOW. When a compare match occurs
 * during the timer up-counting, the output is set HIGH. The output remains HIGH until a compare match occurs again during the timer down-counting.
 * Here, we can see that the ON time of channel 1 and channel 2 are aligned to the time period center.

 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_edge_asymmetric CCU8 in Edge Aligned Asymmetric Mode of Operation
 * In this mode, we can use the 2 compare registers to generate 1 pair of complementary outputs, which means a total of 2 outputs.
 * The minimum duty that can be generated is 0% and the maximum is 100%. Here, the output remains LOW until a channel 1 compare match occurs.
 * This duration can be called "shift". The output remains HIGH until a channel 2 compare match occurs. This duration is determined by the duty.
 * The condition is that the channel 2 register value is required to be greater that the channel 1 register value.
 * This allows us to place the ON time anywhere in the time period, as long as the limiting conditions are met.

 * \subsection subsection_personality_hrpwm_ccu8 CCU8 with HRPWM Mode of Operation
 * \image html hrpwm_ccu8.png "CCU8"
 *
 * <b>Example with XMC4400:</b>
 *
 * \f$ Period = 10. \f$
 *
 * \f$ Duty\:required\:(D) = 60\%. \f$
 *
 * \f$ Cmp_{reg} = \frac{Period \cdot (100 - D)}{100} \f$
 *
 * \f$ Cmp_{reg} = \frac{10 \cdot (100 - 60)}{100} \f$
 *
 * \f$ Cmp_{reg} = 4 \f$
 *
 * Now let us say:
 *
 * \f$ Duty\:required\:(D) = 65\%. \f$
 *
 * \f$ Cmp_{reg} = \frac{10 \cdot (100 - 65)}{100} = 3.5 &cong; 3 \f$
 *
 * With compare register 3, we get a duty of 70%. Therefore, we are not able to get a duty of 65% with a period of 10. Hence, need to use the HRPWM module.

 *
 * The CCU8 output is fed to the HRPWM module. The HRPWM module has two registers - CR1 and CR2. CR1 delays the rising edge of the output, whereas CR2 extends the falling edge of the output.
 * The High Resolution module has a resolution of 150 Pico second. We can achieve the positioning of the output in the step of 150ps. Thus, by configuring the CR1, CR2 registers we can achieve
 * finer generation of the shift and duty. Refer to the reference manual to determine the minimum and maximum duty cycle feasible with the HRPWM module.
