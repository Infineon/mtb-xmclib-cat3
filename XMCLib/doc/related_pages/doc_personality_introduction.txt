 * \section section_personality_introduction Personality Introduction 
 * The XMC Peripheral Library includes a set of files to enable the ModusToolbox™ Device Configurator functionality.
 * These files are known as personalities. They describe the GUI to the microcontroller hardware
 * resources for the Device Configurator in the xml format. Each hardware resource of a microcontroller has its
 * own personality.<br>
 * Based on the user settings, personalities generate initialization code (configuration structures and initialization API calls) executed within the init_cycfg_all() function.
 * The init_cycfg_all() function is usually executed within the cybsp_init() function or may be called directly in the main() function by the user.
 * The system clock personalities generate a strong definition of the SystemCoreClockSetup() function executed at a startup (before jumping to main.c, not within the init_cycfg_all() unlike other ModusToolbox™ PDL products).
 *

 * \subsection subsection_personality_common_groups Common Groups
 * The parameters of microcontroller resources are allocated in groups.
 * Most of the personalities have groups named:<b> Documentation, Connections, Advanced.</b>
 *
 * \anchor paragraph_personality_documentation \par Documentation
 * \parblock
 * The "Documentation" group displays one or more links to the documentation:
 * - <b>API Help:</b> is the link to the application programing interface (API) documentation of the hardware resource to which the current displayed personality is related.
 * - <b>Personality Help:</b> is the link to the documentation of the current personality.
 * \endparblock
 *
 * \anchor paragraph_personality_connections \par Connections
 * \parblock
 * The "Connections" group contains the parameters, which link different personalities and different hardware resources.
 * This way, configurations chains are formed. <br>
 * \endparblock
 *
 * \anchor paragraph_personality_advanced \par Advanced
 * \parblock
 * The "Advanced" group may contain all or one of the listed parameters:
 *
 * - <b>Start After Initialization:</b> If enabled, the peripheral will start at the end of the peripheral initialization.
 * - <b>Store Config in Flash:</b> Controls whether the configuration structure is stored in flash (const, true) or SRAM (not const, false).
