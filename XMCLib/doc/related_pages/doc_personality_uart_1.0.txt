 * There is a possibility to extend the set of pins available as UART RXD input using pins from DX3 and DX5 input stages.
 * By selecting DX3INS connection for RXD signal, the pin configured on DX3 input is used as RXD, for example:

 *
 * Additionally, the pin set for RXD connection could be extended further with DX5 inputs,
 * if DX5INS connection is selected for DX3 input in the previous example:
