 *
 * \note
 * <para>
 * The Ethernet personality has version 0.5 due to the limitations listed below.<br>
 * These limitations will be removed in version 1.0.
 * </para>
 *
 * The Ethernet MAC (ETH) personality provides a graphical interface to configure the ETH hardware module.<br>
 * The settings collected in the ETH Personality GUI allow to configure only part of the consumer's Ethernet application - the physical layer (PHY) and data exchange layer, see the picture below.

 *
 * The network and protocol layers, as well as their configuration, must be implemented by the user in their application. The initialization code generated by the ETH personality is a basic template for the user application or for a code example from the manufacturer.<br>
 *
 * When the ETH Personality connects to a project, an informational message displays in the Notice List pane.
 *
 * \image html eth_personality_permanentMSG.png width=40%
 *
 * The message reminds the user to make additional settings (global preprocessor #define) for the MTB project after completing the settings in the Device Configurator.<br>
 * After performing this additional definition, the function call will become available:<br>
 * <i><b>XMC_ETH_PHY_Init((XMC_ETH_MAC_t*)&myETH_mac, MyETH_PHY_ADDR, &myETH_phy_config);</b></i><br>
 *
 * The global #define can be made in several ways:<br>
 * 1. correct the "DEFINES=" string from the "Advanced Configuration" section in "Makefile" located in the root directory of the project.<br>
 * 2. correct the "BSP_DEFINES:=" string at the beginning of "bsp.mk" located in the "./bsps/TARGET_APP..." directory of the project.<br>
 * 3. configure the project properties by clicking the project\Properties\C/C++ General\Preprocessor Include Path, Macros etc.\CDT User Setting Entries).<br>
 *
 * The ETH personality configurations allow the user to configure the usage of one of the three PHY device drivers included in the XMClib or create their own driver for an alternative PHY device.
 *
 * The interface between the microcontroller and the PHY device may be configured by the personality settings. This may be either an RMII or MII interface. The RMII interface is always available for configuration, but the MII interface is only available for MCUs with more than 100 pins.
 *
 * After selecting the “Enable Autonegotiation” and/or “Poll Received Data”, messages display in the Notice List pane to inform the user to implement such functionality on their own.
 *

 *
 * The selection of the "Receive Broadcast Frames" and "Enable Promiscuous Mode" options just adds function calls to the generated code without displaying messages for the user.
 * \note
 * <para>
 * In addition to the global definition of the PHY device, after completing the ETH Personality settings and code generation by the Device Configurator, it is necessary to additionally initialize the fields (<i><b>.rx_desc, .tx_desc, .rx_buf, .tx_buf</b></i>) of the structure <i><b>myETH_mac</b></i>.<br>
 * The correct addresses of declared arrays must be placed in the structure. The arrays must be independently declared by the user and have a separate attribute to place the arrays into the specialized “ETH_RAM” memory section:<br>
 * <b><i>static <code>__attribute__</code>((aligned(4))) XMC_ETH_MAC_DMA_DESC_t myETH_MTL_rx_desc[myETH_MTL_NUM_RX_BUF] <code>__attribute__</code>((section ("ETH_RAM")));</i></b><br>
 * <b><i>static <code>__attribute__</code>((aligned(4))) XMC_ETH_MAC_DMA_DESC_t myETH_MTL_tx_desc[myETH_MTL_NUM_TX_BUF] <code>__attribute__</code>((section ("ETH_RAM")));</i></b><br>
 * <b><i>static <code>__attribute__</code>((aligned(4))) uint8_t myETH_MTL_rx_buf[myETH_MTL_NUM_RX_BUF][XMC_ETH_MAC_BUF_SIZE] <code>__attribute__</code>((section ("ETH_RAM")));</i></b><br>
 * <b><i>static <code>__attribute__</code>((aligned(4))) uint8_t myETH_MTL_tx_buf[myETH_MTL_NUM_TX_BUF][XMC_ETH_MAC_BUF_SIZE] <code>__attribute__</code>((section ("ETH_RAM")));</i></b><br>
 * </para>
 *
 * \note
 * <para>
 * That specialized memory section must be described in a linker command file which placed in "./bsps/TARGET_APP.../" directory.<br>
