 * The pins of the Pin personality for XMC family microcontrollers do not generate service requests. This feature is determined by the hardware architecture of the XMC family.<br>
 * However, pins can be configured as event resources for the Event Request Unit (ERU), and ERU will generate a service request instead of Pin.<br>
 *
 * To adjust an Interrupt from a pin (GPIO) requires the adjustments by the configurations chain: \ref section_personality_pin "Pin" - \ref subsection_personality_ers "ERU_ERS" - \ref subsection_personality_etl "ERU_ETL" - \ref subsection_personality_ogu "ERU_OGU/Service Request".

 * Refer to the API reference \ref GPIO for the API details. <br>
 * Refer to the device Datasheet and Reference Manual for HW details.
