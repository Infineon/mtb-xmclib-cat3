 * @tableofcontents

 *
 * The XMC Peripheral Library (XMC Lib) consists of low-level drivers for the XMC product family peripherals. <br>
 * Built on top of the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS), it provides access to all peripheral features. <br>
 *
 * @section support Supported devices and toolchains
 * The following 32-Bit Industrial Microcontrollers based on ARM Cortex-M4F are supported:
 * - XMC4800 series
 * - XMC4700 series
 * - XMC4500 series
 * - XMC4300 series
 * - XMC4400 series
 * - XMC4200 series
 * - XMC4100 series
 *
 * The following toolchains are supported:
 * - GNU GCC for ARM 9.3.1 (provided with ModusToolbox 2.3).
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 * XMC Lib consists of routines and data structures which cover all peripheral functions.
 *
 * It provides a peripheral register abstraction by a set of stateless APIs. It is possible to write a full application without a single peripheral register access.
 *
 * It is built on top of Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

 *
 * @section coding Coding Rules and Conventions
 * This section describes the set of coding rules and conventions applied to the XMC Peripheral Library:
 * - Strict C99 usage, in addition unions and bitfields are used for more compact code and data section.
 * - Use only standard data types
 * - Use enumerations in favor of defines
 * - Naming convention:
 *   - Variables use only lower case, underscore separated words.
 *   - Functions use CamelCase convention.
 * - Non blocking APIs for better integration in event driven applications. Polling is supported as well by API.
 * - Runtime error checking can be enabled by user
 * - XMC_ASSERT() used to check input parameters of functions, result of calculations, ... . @note Only enabled if XMC_ASSERT_ENABLE macro is defined
 * - XMC_DEBUG() used to monitor status of application. @note Only enabled if XMC_DEBUG_ENABLE macro is defined
 * - Each driver defines its own namespace: every function and type definition is prefixed by a unique identifier, i.e. XMC_VADC
 *
 * XMC Peripheral Library follows an object oriented approach, where instances of peripherals are treated as objects = attributes + functions.<br>
 * Attributes are the peripheral data structures defined in device header file. These gets configured using configuration data structures using initialization functions.<br>
 * Peripheral functions take a pointer to the peripheral data struct as the first argument.<br>
 * XMC Peripheral Library uses naming conventions to bind the data struct and the functions that operate on i, i.e. XMC_PERI_DoSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri, ...);
 *
 * Typically a driver contains the following functionality:
 * 1. Initialization function
 * @code
 * XMC_PERI_STATUS_t XMC_PERI_Init(XMC_PERI_t *const peri, const XMC_PERI_CONFIG_t const *config);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 2. Enable/disable peripheral functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Enable(XMC_PERI_t *const peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Disable(XMC_PERI_t *const peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 3. Connectivity functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_SetInputSource(XMC_PERI_t *const peri, ...);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 4. Event handling functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Enable(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Disable(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_EnableEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_DisableEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_TriggerEvent(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * uint32_t XMC_PERI_GetEventStatus(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_SetInterruptNode(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 5. Control functions
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_Start(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Stop(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Suspend(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * void XMC_PERI_Resume(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 6. Get/setters functions, run time API to obtain or modify state of peripheral
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_SetSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri, ...);
 * uint32_t XMC_PERI_GetSomething(XMC_PERI_t const *peri);
 * @endcode
 *
 * 7. IRQ Handlers are provided which can be used optionally by the user to make easier the coding
 * @code
 * void XMC_PERI_IRQHandler(uint32_t sr_num);
 * @endcode
 *
 * A peripheral driver is structured as:
 * - Common API valid for all the supported devices, i.e. xmc_gpio.h and xmc_gpio.c
 * - Family specific extension API, i.e. xmc4_gpio.h and xmc4_gpio.c
 * - Maps files to help user to configure connectivity, i.e. xmc4_gpio_map.h already has defined all the pins available depending on the target device selected.
 *
 * If needed the family extension API implementation file, i.e. xmc4_gpio.c, can also overload common functionality to adapt it to target device.
 * The peripheral driver abstracts the target device, helping the user in code porting to another family or device.

 *
 * @section usage How to use the XMC Peripheral Library
 * The following steps are required:
 * 1. Include header file of required peripheral. No need to include device specific peripheral header files,
      this is done automatically using the information of the selected target device.
 * 2. Peripheral configuration and initialization.
 * 3. Connectivity configuration.
 * 4. Event/interrupt configuration.
 * 5. Start operation.
 * 6. IO configuration.
 * 7. Manage peripheral.
 *
 * @code
 * /* Include files */
 * #include "xmc_gpio.h"
 * #include "xmc_i2c.h"
 * ...
 * int main(void)
 * {
 *   /* Peripheral configuration and initialization. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_CONFIG_t i2c_cfg;
 *   i2c_cfg.baudrate = 400000U;
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_Init(XMC_I2C0_CH0, &i2c_cfg);
 *
 *   /* Connectivity configuration. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_SetInputSource(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_INPUT_SDA, USIC1_C0_DX0_P2_14);
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_SetInputSource(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_INPUT_SCL, USIC1_C0_DX1_P5_8);
 *
 *   /* Event/interrupt configuration. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_EnableEvent(XMC_I2C0_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_EVENT_ARBITRATION_LOST);
 *   NVIC_SetPriority(USIC0_0_IRQn, NVIC_GetPriorityGrouping(), 63, 0);
 *   NVIC_EnableIRQ(USIC0_0_IRQn);
 *
 *   /* Start operation. */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_Start(XMC_I2C0_CH0);
 *
 *   /* IO configuration. */
 *   XMC_GPIO_SetMode(P1_5, XMC_GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN | P1_5_AF_U0C0_DOUT0);
 *   XMC_GPIO_SetMode(P1_1, XMC_GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN | P1_1_AF_U0C0_SCLKOUT);
 *   ...
 *   /* Manage peripheral */
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_MasterStart(XMC_I2C1_CH0, IO_EXPANDER_ADDRESS, XMC_I2C_CH_CMD_WRITE);
 *   while((XMC_I2C_CH_GetStatusFlag(XMC_I2C1_CH0) & XMC_I2C_CH_STATUS_FLAG_ACK_RECEIVED) == 0U)
 *   {
 *   /* wait for ACK */
 *   }
 *   XMC_I2C_CH_ClearStatusFlag(XMC_I2C1_CH0, XMC_I2C_CH_STATUS_FLAG_ACK_RECEIVED);
