# XMCLib

**Note:** This is Early Access Software for XMC devices in ModusToolbox. This software is made available for evaluation purposes only and is not recommended for production development.

## Overview

The XMC Peripheral Library (XMCLib) consists of low-level drivers for the XMC product family peripherals.
The XMCLib integrates device header files, startup code, and
peripheral drivers into a single package. The drivers abstract the hardware functions into a set of
easy-to-use APIs.

## Features

* Contains standard set of XMC® digital and analog peripheral drivers that enable rapid peripheral software development in third-party IDEs
* The ARM Cortex® Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) core access header files
* CMSIS compliant device header files, startup code (platform initialization) and device configuration header files
