Please refer to the [README](./README.md) and the XMCLib for [XMC1000](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-xmclib-cat3/xmc1_api_reference_manual/html/index.html)/[XMC4000](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-xmclib-cat3/xmc4_api_reference_manual/html/index.html) API Reference Manual for a complete description.

## What Changed?

* Added support for the ModusToolbox 3.0.
* UDD and CMSIS-core removed from package. Now these are delivered as separate libraries.
* Added cy_toolchain_init() call into the startup code as required by the CLib FreeRTOS Support Library.

## Updated personalities

All clock personalities - clock accuracy parameter added.
I2C, UART - imposing restrictions on data connections to accept pins only.
Pin - expanded connectivity and settings for Hardware Controlled pin mode.
FDIVCLK - Updated to properly handle XMC1x00 devices which have no clock doubler block.
