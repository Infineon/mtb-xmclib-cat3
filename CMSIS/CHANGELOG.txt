## [5.7.0-p1] - 2020-11
Based on CMSIS 5.7.0 with Infineon specific files
See https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/releases for changes on CMSIS 5.7.0

### Added
- Option to generate own ISR handlers for interrupts instead of a single common default ISR
- Scatter files for ARM compiler v5 and v6
### Changed
- Infineon specific files uses now the Boost Software License, https://www.boost.org/users/license.html
- Device header files to avoid compilation warnings in Keil MDK

  Fix clock setup when using internal oscillator as clock source for the system PLL
- system_XMC4200.c
  Fix EXTCLKDIV macro definition
  Fix code for condition EXTCLK_PIN == EXTCLK_PIN_P1_15
  Fix clock setup when using internal oscillator as clock source for the system PLL
- system_XMC4300.c

### Added
- CMSIS Driver implementation

## [5.6.0-p1] - 2019-08-01
Based on CMSIS 5.6.0 with Infineon specific files
See https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/releases for changes on CMSIS 5.6.0


## [5.5.1-p1] - 2019-06-05
Based on CMSIS 5.5.1 with Infineon specific files
See https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/releases for changes on CMSIS 5.5.1
### Added
- system_XMC1400.c 
  Added DISABLE_WAIT_RTC_XTAL_OSC_STARTUP preprocessor guard:
    The RTC_XTAL can be used as clock source for RTC or as reference for DCO1 calibration 
    In both cases if no wait is done in the startup after enabling the RTC_XTAL oscillator,
    the RTC_Enable() or the calibration will stall the MCU until the oscillator is stable (max. 5s according datasheet)
- Added XMC1xxx scatter files for ARMCC6
- Extended ROM XMC1xxx functions to incorporate _CalcTemperature, _NvmEraseSector, _NvmProgVerifyBlock, _CalcTSEVAR

- system_XMC4100.c
  Fix variable location of SystemCoreClock, g_hrpwm_char_data and g_chipid for ARMCC compiler
- system_XMC4200.c
